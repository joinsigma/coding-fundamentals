1. Why do we need a loop? How do you write a basic for loop?

Loop is a piece of code that executes its inner tasks or codes based on the
condition. The condition return is usually in terms of true or false.
The loop will iterate the codes within it as long as the condition is true,
and it will stop iterating its inner codes when the condition is false.
Given that nature, loop is important in completing the repetitive task for
it not only reduces the program time to complete such tasks, but also 
simplifies the structure of codes by eliminating any redundancy.

For example, if we would like to calculate the sum of an array of number,
without loop, we would have to write out every single elements of the
array to do the summation line by line. On the contrary, by using loop,
we can loop through every single element of the array and sum them up
within the loop structure. This can be done with just a single line of
code!

To write a basic for loop, there are few concerns:
Firstly, the 'for()' word and the initialisation of 'i' variable wiithin the 
for (), by "let i = 0 ".

Secondly, the (condition). The (condition) can be in form of (i<=a) or
(i>=a), where the former checking if i variable is of smaller or equivalent 
value as variable a and vice versa. This is important as it sets the limit
of the condition.

Thirdly, the increment or decerment or manipulation of variable i, such as
i ++, i --, i * 2 etc.

Fourthy, the codes within the for loop.

The overall loop structure is shown below:
 for ( let i = 0 ; i < = a ; i ++ ){

2. Difference between console.log() and return?

console.log() displays the values within it to the terminal,
but it will not pass any value to any variable or function.

return will pass the values to any variable or function,
but it will not display any value to the terminal.

3. What are truthy values? What are falsy values?

Truthy values are any value that is considered as 'true'
when they are defined in Boolean context. By default,
all values are truthy, except some exception.

The exception such as 0 , -0, null, "", undefined, NaN, false,
empty sequences are falsy values. They are false when being 
defined in Boolean context.

4. How does the internet work?

Internet is formed by connections of computing and networking
devices across the globe. In fact, all main connections are found 
in undersea cables across the oceans of the Earth. Hence, the
network connection as we have today is formed by those
hundred of thousands kilometres of cables lying on the seabed. 

Now, we will focus on discrete and smaller field of view. 
Our PC or device is connected either wireless or in wire, to the modem or
router. Router helps connect our devices to the networks of other region
across the globe whereas modem connects our devices to the ISP. ISP is
a company that manages special routers that can access other ISP's
routers. Hence, our network, if connected to our local ISP, is
technically connected to the networks of other ISP around the globe.
This is how the network of whole world is connected.

5. How does a website work? What files are involved?

When we type a URL of a website, our query will be pushed to ISP which connects
to different servers that store and send data such as NAP server and
DNS. Then, DNS will look up to the IP address through the domain name
we have typed. Our browser will then sends a HTTP request to the server
to send a copy of the client using TCP/IP protocol. The server approves
the request and sends data packet of website files to the browser.
Our browser then reassembles data packets and the website is loaded
completely. This is how the internet works when we browsing a certain
website.

The files involved are the code files and the assets. The code files consist of
HTML, CSS and Javascript. Assets file is a collective of other stuff that make
up the website, such as images, videos, music, PDF etc.
